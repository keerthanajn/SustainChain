## Introduction
Sustainchain aims to promote sustainability by encouraging users to organize and participate in sustainable events that align with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Leveraging the VeChainThor blockchain, users can create events, join existing ones, and earn tokens for their participation.

## What does sustainchain do
**Event Creation**: Users can create sustainable events, specifying details such as date, time, location, and the SDGs the event supports.

**Event Participation**: Users can browse and join existing sustainable events, contributing to the causes they care about.

**Token Rewards**: Participants earn tokens for their involvement in events, which can be converted into VeChain cryptocurrency.

**Whitelisting**: The dApp features a whitelisting mechanism that rewards users for creating and managing sustainable projects and events.
